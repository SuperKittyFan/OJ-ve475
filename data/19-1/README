This is a program based on the Playfair cipher, the plaintext,key and cipher text should be string composed of capital letter. 
The description: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher
command --generate will generate a key with length 26
when encrypting or decrypting, please input the key or generate one, otherwise the program will report an error.
This cipher will add X into two same adjacent letters and at last if the letter numer is odd, and it takes I and J as the same letter, therefore, X and I, J in the decrpted ciphertext should be judged accordingly.
