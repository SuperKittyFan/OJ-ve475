if you want to generate/set your own key you should first call -g or --generate to generate a random key, -k or --key to set your own key. If you directly call --encrypt or --decrypt, a default key is used. Key followed by -k or --key will be decoded as hex string.

i.e. --key abcdef1 gives 0x0abcdef1
     --key abcdef gives 0x00abcdef
in case the input key is not long enough, the lack part will be replace by 0; if the key is longer than the required key, the overflow part will be ignored.

If the plain text is not long enough, then the program will add '.' to the end
If the cipher text is not long enough, then the program will add 'A' to the end

The plain/cipher text only contains [A..Z], [a..z], [,.]
