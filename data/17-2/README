This is variant from the first cipher. 

It only supports the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9 in its keys, plain text and cipher text. 

The main procedure is similar to the standard RC4 algorithm. The main difference is that is algorithm uses modular arithmetic rather than bitwise XOR.

The algorithm only need one symmetric key, the key generated by using the generate option will be randomly sized from 25 to 128 characters.
