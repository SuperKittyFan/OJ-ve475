It is a RC4 algorithm.

Information about RC4 is in the following website.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4

Instructions:
1. The program includes a Makefile. To compile the program, run "make" in the terminal.
2. After compiling, run “./c2 —generate” to generate a key. Also, you can set the key by yourself. Note that the length of the key is less or equal to 256 bits.
3. To encrypt, run “./c2 —encrypt “plaintext” —key “key””.
4. To decrypt, run “./c2 —decrypt “ciphertext” —key “key””.

Tips:
1. If you have “!” in your input, remember to write it as “\!”. Otherwise, the program can not be run.
2. The plaintext and ciphertext should be less or equal to 1024 bits.
3. The key should be less or equal to 256 bits.
4. Any other types of input except the three mentioned in Instruction 1, 2, 3, will be treated as wrong input.
