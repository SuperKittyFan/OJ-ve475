This program is a simple 128-bit AES cipher and it can realize four functions
1. generate: generate a random key.
2. encrypt: encrypt a message
3. decrypt: decrypt a message
4. key: use the specified key to encrypt or decrypt

128-bit AES: The key has 128 bits. If the user provides the key, it will encrypt the message
using that key while it will use an random key to encrypt. Similarly for decryption.

The program will divide the message into several blocks, and each block has 16 bits. If some
block has less than 16 bits, it will append some random numbers. Then the program uses AES to
encrypt each block. Similarly for decryption.
