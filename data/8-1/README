The program is an implement of 128-bit AES based on lecture note.

The plaintext to be encrypted should be in character string, and if its length cannot be divided by 16 bytes, 0 will be padded at the end.

The ciphertext to be decrypted should be in hex string, and if its length cannot be divided by 16 bytes, 0 will be padded at the end.

The key also should be 128-bit. Otherwise, the program will generate a random 128-bit key.

If the attacker does not use a special key, the 128-bit key will be generated randomly.

The output of encryption and decrytion will be in hex. Two digits maps into one character.
