	<p> Welcome! </p>
	<h2 class="content-subhead"> Phase 1 </h2>
	<p>The goal of the first phase is to implement some ciphers with respect to the following rules.</p>
	<h2 class="content-subhead"> Phase 2 </h2>
	<p>For two weeks starting July 4th every team will be able to run blackbox attacks in order to break each otherâ€™s encryption schemes. The goal is to recover the plaintexts corresponding to the ciphertexts. In this second phase the attacks will be run through a website whose address will be provided. The process is as follows:</p>
	<h2 class="content-subhead"> Phase 3 </h2>
	<p>On July 18th, all the source codes of the still unbroken ciphers will be uploaded on Sakai. Any kind of
attack will then be allowed, including for instance side-channel attacks.</p>
	<h2 class="content-subhead"> Rewards </h2>
	<p>For each implementation, the ciphertext to break should be rated with a number of credits to be won when its corresponding plaintext is recovered. The total credits for all the implementations of a team should be 10. If the secret key is also recovered using a cryptographic attack a bonus of +2 credits will be awarded.</p>
	<h2 class="content-subhead"> Important Notes </h2>
	<p> Please read carefully those final comments.</p>
